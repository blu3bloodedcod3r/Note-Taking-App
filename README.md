  # Note-Taking-App

  ##Description
-My motivation for this project was to further learn and understand how to use EXPRESS.JS
- I completed this project so that I may further be able to further my knowledge how express is used and how it works.
- This would solve problems from completely having to build certain things from sratch in JS.
- I learned that I need more tutoring for this section of the course and will be utilizing outside resources to further my understanding.
